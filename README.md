# Deep Learning Model Exploration
## Overview

This repository features a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that delves into the exploration of deep learning model architectures and hyperparameter tuning. The project is structured to systematically investigate the effects of various architectural changes and hyperparameter adjustments on model performance.

## Experimentation Structure
Impact of Changing Model Architecture
This section conducts a series of experiments to understand how altering the depth and width of a neural network influences its performance. The exploration is segmented as follows:

## Baseline Model:

A reference implementation to establish baseline performance metrics.
## Deeper Network:

An experiment that extends the baseline model with additional layers to assess the impact of depth.
## Wider Network: 

This experiment increases the neuron count in each layer to explore the effects of network width.
## Findings: 

A synthesis of insights gathered from the architectural adjustments, highlighting key takeaways.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Focused on fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters, this section documents the experimentation with various configurations to optimize performance.

# Models 1-4: 

Detailed accounts of the experimentation with different hyperparameters, including the rationale behind each choice and its observed impact.
Model Comparison: A collective evaluation and comparison of the models based on their performance, offering a clear perspective on the effectiveness of each hyperparameter set.
Getting Started

## Prerequisites:
Getting Started
Prerequisites

This project requires the following libraries and tools:

- Python (version 3.x is recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- TensorFlow (or replace with the deep learning framework you used)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Install these dependencies using pip with the following command:

pip install jupyterlab, tensorflow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib

Or, if you prefer using conda, create a new environment and install the packages like this:

conda create --name deep_learning python=3.x

conda activate deep_learning

conda install jupyterlab tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib

Replace 3.x with the specific Python version you're using.

# Running the Notebook
Follow these steps to run the notebook:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are installed and, if using a virtual environment, that it's activated.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook by executing one of the following commands:

- jupyter lab
- jupyter notebook

4. Jupyter will open in your web browser.
5. Locate and open the notebook file from the Jupyter interface.
6. Execute the cells sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter or using the run button in the toolbar.
